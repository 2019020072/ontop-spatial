## Bug report 

1. First check if you are using the latest version of Ontop
2. If you are sure you find a bug, use GitHub Issues to submit the report; otherwise, you may want to the mail list for the discussion.
3. When reporting a bug, please provide a minimal use case if possible.


## Contributing Code

Know how to fix something or provide new features? 

For trivial contribution (e.g. fixing typos in the docs), please use the Pull Requst of GitHub.

For non-trivial contribution, please contact us first.
