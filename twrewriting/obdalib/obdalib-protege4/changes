Changes, updates and bugfixes in obdalib-protege4

Changes in classes OBDAPluginController and OWLAPICoupler.
The change in these classes are mainly due to the synchronization part. This includes 
the usage of the new classes and an implementation of a few new methods especially 
the coupler where we added some new function for the usage of the prefixes and the 
interaction with the prefix manager. Furthermore the coupler is able to provide information
not only about one ontology but about all loaded ontolgies. For the implementation of 
this feature we created the class OntologyEntityInformation. Basically for each loaded ontology
the coupler creates an new instance of this class with a reference to the ontology. So the 
coupler can keep track of all ontolgies and process requests about all loaded ontolgies.
The only new function in the OBDAPluginController is the setCurrentOntologyURI method. It was 
necessary to add them, since the user now has the possibility ot switch between several ontologies.

New Classes:
Furthermore for the implemention of the synchronisation between ontology and mappings we had to
add a few new classes. 
The OntologyEntityInformation was already introduces in the above section.
The OBDAPluginDataManager is only a slightly modification of the original one. The only new thing
is that when loading an obda file it looks for some defined prefixes which then are added to the
prefix Manager.
The SynchronizedMappingController is responsible for appling the changes done in the onotlogy
the mappings. The changes we are talking about are the adding, deleting and renaming entities. 
This new controller listens to such Change Events and applies them to the mappings.

Note: There might be some other classes which contain some change, but they are of minor interest and 
are often only some changes in the imports or new lines, etc.
