Changes, updates and bugfixes in obdalib

New Classes:
EntityNameRenderer: The entity name renderer is used to get the right representation of 
atom names. It is responsable for combining the atom name respectivly functor name with the
right prefixes.
PrefixManager: Is responable for managing the registerd prefixes. It allows you add and delete 
prefixes for ontolgy URI's and allows you to query them. 
DatalogConjunctiveQueryCodec: Its a simple codec which allows to decode respectivly encode 
conjunctive queries into XML
MappingXMLCodec: Its a simple codec which allows to decode respectivly encode 
obda mapping axioms into XML
UCQDatalogStringRenderer:  Its a simple renderer which allows to represent union
conjunctive queries into plain text.
SourceQueryToTextCodec: Its a simple codec which allows to represent source queries
into plain text.
TargetQueryToTextCodec: Its a simple codec which allows to represent target queries
into plain text.

Changes in classes 

All changes in existing classes are mainly due to the usage of the URI's instead of String
for identifying atoms. 
A few classes like the APIController, the APICoupler, the DatalogCQParser, most of
the classes involved with mappings and a few other contain also changes due to the 
usage of prefixes when displaying the mappings. 
Especially the Parser has been modified quite a bit. He has now to handle atoms with no 
prefix, with prefix or even the whole URI, dependingon what ontolgy is selected 
and what mappings are displayed. 
Furthermore some of the classes respeonsable for displaying mappings or 
dumping them to XML contain changes due to some modifications of how to represent
conjunctive queries or atom as plain text or XML. Each of this classes have now appropriate Renderer, 
both for plain test representation and XML representation.
