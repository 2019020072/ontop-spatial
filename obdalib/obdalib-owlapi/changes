Changes, updates and bugfixes in obdalib-owlapi

Changes in classes OBDAPluginController and OWLAPICoupler.
The change in these classes are mainly due to the synchronization part. This includes 
the usage of the new classes and an implementation of a few new methods especially 
the coupler where we added some new function for the usage of the prefixes and the 
interaction with the prefix manager. 

New Classes:
Furthermore for the implemention of the synchronisation between ontology and mappings we had to
add a few new classes. 
The OBDAPluginDataManager is only a slightly modification of the original one. The only new thing
is that when loading an obda file it looks for some defined prefixes which then are added to the
prefix Manager.
The SynchronizedMappingController is responsible for appling the changes done in the onotlogy
the mappings. The changes we are talking about are the adding, deleting and renaming entities. 
This new controller listens to such Change Events and applies them to the mappings.

Note: 
Since we have no running scenario, with which we could test the new implementations, the whole new 
is untested, so the new classes have to used with care.

TODO:
Test the new classes and esure nothing is missing.
